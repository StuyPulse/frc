About RobotPy
===============

`RobotPy`_ is a distribution of `Python`_ intended to be used for the `FIRST
Robotics Competition`_.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in
Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

Installation
==============

Unzip the release .zip to a temporary directory.

Connect to your robot's IP with an FTP client (e.g. ``ftp://10.XX.YY.2/``,
where XXYY is your team number).  Copy all files and directories in the
distribution's ``robot`` directory to the root (top level) directory on the
robot.  Note: this will overwrite any UserProgram.out currently on the robot
with the Python interpreter.
