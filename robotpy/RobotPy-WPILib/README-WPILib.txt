Installation
==============

Unzip the release .zip to a temporary directory.

Connect to your robot's IP with an FTP client (e.g. ``ftp://10.XX.YY.2/``,
where XXYY is your team number).  Copy all files and directories in the
distribution's ``robot`` directory to the root (top level) directory on the
robot.
