/**
 * Sample line tracking class for FIRST 2011 Competition
 * Jumpers on driver station digital I/O pins select the operating mode:
 * The Driver Station digital input 1 select whether the code tracks the straight
 * line or the forked line. Driver station digital input 2 selects whether the
 * code takes the left or right fork. You can set these inputs using jumpers on
 * the USB I/O module or in the driver station I/O Configuration pane (if there
 * is no Digital I/O module installed.
 *
 * Since there is the fork to contend with, the code tracks the edge of the line
 * using a technique similar to that used with a single-sensor Lego robot.
 *
 * This code worked on a simple bot built from the 2011 kit chassis and weighted
 * to behave similarly to complete robot complete with scoring mechanisms. Your
 * own robot will likely be geared differently, the CG will be different, the
 * wheels may be different - so expect to tune the program for your own robot
 * configuration. The two places to do tuning are:
 *
 * defaultSteeringGain - this is the amount of turning correction applied
 * forkProfile & straightProfile - these are power profiles applied at various
 * times (one power setting / second of travel) as the robot moves towards
 * the wall.
 *
 * In addition: this program uses dead reckoning - that is it drives at various
 * power settings so it will slow down and stop at the end of the line. This is
 * highly dependent on robot weight, wheel choice, and battery voltage. It will
 * behave differently on a fully charged vs. partially charged battery.
 *
 * To overcome these limitations, you should investigate the use of feedback to
 * have power/wheel independent control of the program. Examples of feedback
 * include using wheel encoders to measure the distance traveled or some kind of
 * rangefinder to determine the distance to the wall. With these sensors installed
 * your program can know precisely how far from the wall it is, and set the speeds
 * accordingly.
