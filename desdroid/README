"FRC DS Data Storage.ini" contains the proper Driver Station configuration for controlling DESdroid. Most importantly, it contains the pin configurations (pulled high, output, etc.), as well as pin labels, for the DESdroid operator interface box.
On the competition Driver Station, the existing configuration file should be overwritten with this one. On a Windows 7 Driver Station, it can be located at "C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\FRC".
