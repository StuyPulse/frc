/**
 * Provide easy support for critical regions.
 * A critical region is an area of code that is always executed under mutual exclusion. Only
 * one task can be executing this code at any time. The idea is that code that manipulates data
 * that is shared between two or more tasks has to be prevented from executing at the same time
 * otherwise a race condition is possible when both tasks try to update the data. Typically
 * semaphores are used to ensure only single task access to the data.
 * Synchronized objects are a simple wrapper around semaphores to help ensure that semaphores
 * are always signaled (semGive) after a wait (semTake).
