// Extends TractionControlledDriveTrain

// Could be called TwoMotorTractionControlledDriveTrain, but the name got too long.



// This is the most likely drivetrain for this year's bot
// Populates the the array of speed controllers inherited from BaseDriveTrain with TWO SpeedController objects passed into the constructor

// Define joystick methods, as well as autonomous "setOffset()" or "rotate(int deg)" as they would work for a two motor tank drive train (one motor to a side)

// Remember, using the inherited setMotor() method will automatically smooth out to your requests.
