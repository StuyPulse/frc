DriveTrain objects are split up into their inherited categories because we reuse drivetrains year after year. They never really change.

Robots, however, change greatly each year. So does the game. This is why it's best to keep the robot as its own class, with all of its sensors and motors contained at its level.


We can feel free to add more objects, of course, as we need them.
